Project Report: College Football Win Rates

# Executive Summary
The study embarked on a multifaceted analysis aimed at identifying significant predictors of the 'winRate' for a sports dataset. Advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and gradient descent for linear regression, along with AdaBoost with Shallow Regression Trees, were employed to distill insights and enhance predictive performance.

The 'winRate' was selected as the focal point of our prediction efforts due to its fundamental role in gauging the success and performance of college football teams. This metric encapsulates the outcome of matches, reflecting the culmination of various team dynamics, strategies, and external factors. By predicting 'winRate,' we aim to unravel the intricate relationships between diverse features and game outcomes, providing valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and stakeholders in the realm of college football.

# Machine Learning Approach
The initiation of the machine learning endeavor strategically involved designating 'winRate' as the target variable, a critical metric for assessing the success of college football teams. Employing sophisticated methodologies, encompassing Random Forest, gradient descent for linear regression, and AdaBoost with Shallow Regression Trees, we systematically pinpointed salient features such as 'TotalPoints,' 'ScoringDefRank,' 'AvgPointsPerGameAllowed,' and 'PointsPerGame' through the discerning analysis of the Random Forest Regressor. This rigorous procedure established the groundwork for subsequent data preparation and feature selection, charting a course towards exhaustive insights and elevated predictive efficacy.
